# Midterm Project Proposal
### Matthew Eschman - MTEC-340
## Chase Clicker (better name pending)
My game is, as expected, inspired by idle/clicker games like Cookie Clicker, Adventure Capitalist, and the Gnorp Apologue. The core systems of these games revolve around clicking a button, getting currency, and buying upgrades. My game differs from similar idle games because the core "clicking" action is replaced by the player chasing a moving field where they can earn currency. Like other clicker games, I aim to include upgrades to improve your efficiency and powerups that give you a big boost all at once.
### Good Outcome
- Player character that can be moved around using keyboard controls
- Moving zone that provides the player with currency while they are within its boundaries
- Home screen, pause menu, and gameplay UI
- Upgrades (potentially involving run speed, zone size, or income rate)
- Sound effects for buying upgrades or reaching milestones
### Better Outcome
- Powerups that give a temporary boost, a one time bonus, or a less than desirable surprise
- Simple BGM music changing between states when you are in vs out of the zone
- A "prestige" system allowing the player to reset their progress in exchange for more valuable upgrades, possibly introducing a secondary currency
- Simple obstacles that get in the player's way or objects that influence the movement of the zone (may require a visual indicator if the zone leaves the player's vision)
### Best Outcome
- Growing and shrinking screen size and scaling all other sprites to fit the changed scale of the screen
- A "prestige" system allowing the player to reset their progress in exchange for more valuable upgrades, possibly introducing alternate currencies
- Control schemes allowing for both keyboard and mouse, just keyboard, and just mouse
- Dangerous obstacles that punish the player if they touch, causing a death screen and the loss of some points
- "FPS Mode" using mouse controls, the player follows the mouse position and the zone changes position quickly acting like an FPS aim trainer
- "Hubris" punishments for spending too much on one upgrade
