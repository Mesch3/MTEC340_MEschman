## Chase Clicker
### Concept
Game inspired by clicker/idle games focused on movement and upgrades
### Gameplay
The Main mechanic involves the player chasing after a moving zone. When the player is within the zone, their score increases. The player may spend their score points to obtain upgrade to stats like movement speed, zone size, and income rate.

The zone moves somewhat randomly, and is located within a "maze" that makes it more difficult to chase after.

Power-ups will appear and can be picked up by the player, providing an immediate boost like a score increase or a temporary boost to things like player speed.
### Interface
The game HUD will include a score total, time played, and upgrades.

The player will control their movement using the WASD keys. The player will purchase upgrades using the number keys and pause the game using P or Esc. The pause menu will use WASD and Enter/Return for navigation.

Scoring will operate off of collision between the player and the zone. Power-ups will also rely on player collision.
### Art Style
The final product will use mostly simple sprites with simple animation. There will be slightly more developed sprites for the player, the zone, and power-ups while the obstacles will be as simplistic as possible.

Game sound will include effects for buying upgrades and picking up power-ups. Ambient music will have two layered tracks with one always playing and the other only playing while the play is in the zone.
