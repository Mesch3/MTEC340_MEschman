# My Favorite Game
My Favorite game is Hollow Knight by [Team Cherry](https://www.teamcherry.com.au/). I love this game because it combines excellent character and enemy designs with rewarding combat and platforming challenges. The soundtrack by Christopher Larkin also helped draw me to this game. The game was released on the 24th of February in 2017 and was built in Unity. <br>
